## 📌 Why I Built This  

Living in **Austin, Texas**, I often **forgot to check the weather** before heading out. Since it rains frequently, I wanted an app that would **automatically notify me in the morning** if rain was expected.  

### 🌟 Features  
✅ **Checks the weather forecast** for the day based on **your location**  
✅ **Sends a text message (SMS) only if it’s going to rain** ☔  
✅ **Uses OpenWeather API** for real-time weather data  
✅ **Automated notifications every morning** based on your wake-up time  
✅ **Uses Twilio API** to send SMS alerts

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. The app **fetches weather data** from the **OpenWeather API** for your location.  
2. If **rain is detected** in the forecast, the app **triggers an SMS alert** via Twilio.  
3. You receive a **text message** reminding you to **bring an umbrella** ☂️.  
4. **No spam!** The app **only sends a message when rain is detected.**
